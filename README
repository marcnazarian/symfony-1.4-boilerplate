# Symfony 1.4 boilerplate

This project is a Symfony skeleton with 
- one app (named frontend),
- one action/template (index) that display a list of forum messages
- one model (Forum) with fake messages (static messages, no database required)

The purpose of this boilerplate is to provide a full *test* environment
for those who want to start with Symfony 1.4:
- Unit tests with PHPUnit
- Functional tests with Behat2 and Mink



1. how to run unit test

    phpunit --configuration=test/configuration.xml --bootstrap=test/bootstrap/unit.php test/

2. how to run (failing) functional test

    cd test/bdd/
    behat homepage.feature

3. how to run all the test suite (maven required)

    mvn clean test
