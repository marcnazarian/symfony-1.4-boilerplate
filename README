# Symfony 1.4 boilerplate

This project is a Symfony skeleton with 
- one app (named frontend),
- one action/template (index) that display a list of forum messages
- one model (Forum) with fake messages (static messages, no database required)

The purpose of this boilerplate is to provide a full *test* environment
for those who want to start with Symfony 1.4:
- Unit tests with PHPUnit
- Functional tests with Behat2 and Mink
